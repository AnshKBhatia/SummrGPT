# SummrGPT
SummarGPT is a machine learning model designed for automatic summarization tasks. It leverages GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) architecture, which is known for its ability to generate human-like text.SummarGPT efficiently creates concise summaries from large bodies of text while retaining key ideas and relevant information.
Key Features

    Abstractive Summarization: Rather than extracting whole sentences, SummarGPT rephrases and compresses the original text, producing fluent, cohesive summaries.
    Fine-tuned for Accuracy: Trained on a variety of datasets, SummarGPT ensures precise, meaningful summarization across multiple domains such as news articles, academic papers,     legal documents, and more.
    Multilingual Capability: Supports summarization in multiple languages, making it a versatile tool for global use.
    Scalable: Capable of handling texts of various lengths, from short paragraphs to long documents.
